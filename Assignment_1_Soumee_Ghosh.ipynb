       "'Page: Elon Musk salute controversy\\nSummary: On January 20, 2025, while speaking at a rally celebrating U.S. president Donald Trump\\'s second inauguration, businessman and political figure Elon Musk twice made a salute interpreted by many as a Nazi or a fascist Roman salute.\\nIt was widely condemned as an intentional Nazi salute in Germany, where making such gestures is illegal. The Anti-Defamation League said it was not a Nazi salute, but other Jewish organizations disagreed and condemned the salute. American public opinion was divided on partisan lines as to whether it was a fascist salute. Musk dismissed the accusations of Nazi sympathies, deriding them as \"dirty tricks\" and a \"tired\" attack. Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups celebrated it as a Nazi salute. Multiple European political parties demanded that Musk be banned from entering their countries.\\n\\n\\n\\nPage: Acquisition of Twitter by Elon Musk\\nSummary: Businessman and U.S. political figure Elon Musk initiated an acquisition of the American social media company Twitter, Inc. on April 14, 2022, and concluded it on October 27, 2022. Musk had begun buying shares of the company in January 2022, becoming its largest shareholder by April with a 9.1 percent ownership stake. Twitter invited Musk to join its board of directors, an offer he initially accepted before declining. On April 14, Musk made an unsolicited offer to purchase the company, to which Twitter\\'s board responded with a \"poison pill\" strategy to resist a hostile takeover before unanimously accepting Musk\\'s buyout offer of $44 billion on April 25. Musk stated that he planned to introduce new features to the platform, make its algorithms open-source, combat spambot accounts, and promote free speech, framing the acquisition as the cornerstone of X, an \"everything app\".\\nIn July, Musk announced his intention to terminate the agreement, asserting that Twitter had breached their agreement by refusing to crack down on spambot accounts. The company filed a lawsuit against Musk in the Delaware Court of Chancery shortly thereafter, with a trial scheduled for the week of October 17. Weeks before the trial was set to begin, Musk reversed course, announcing that he would move forward with the acquisition. The deal was closed on October 28, with Musk immediately becoming Twitter\\'s new owner and CEO. Twitter was taken private and merged into a new parent company named X Corp. Musk promptly fired several top executives, including previous CEO Parag Agrawal. Musk has since proposed several reforms to Twitter and laid off half of the company\\'s workforce. Hundreds of employees then resigned from the company after Musk issued an ultimatum demanding they commit to \"extremely hardcore\" work. Linda Yaccarino was appointed CEO of X Corp. In July 2023, the Twitter service was rebranded as X.\\nReactions to the buyout were mixed, with praise for Musk\\'s planned reforms and vision for the company, particularly his calls for greater free speech, but criticism over fears of a potential rise in misinformation and disinformation, harassment, and hate speech on the platform. Within the United States, conservatives have largely supported the acquisition, while many liberals and former Twitter employees have voiced concerns about Musk\\'s intentions. Since becoming owner, Musk has faced backlash for his handling of the company and account suspensions, including the December 2022 suspensions of ten journalists.\\n\\n'"

Klender](https://www.teslarati.com/author/joey-klender/ \"Posts by Joey Klender\")[](https://twitter.com/KlenderJoey)\\n\\nJim Cramer’s love affair with Tesla and Elon Musk appears to be over, based on recent comments the long-time _Mad Money_ host has made in the past few months. Cramer flipped from bear to bull on Tesla stock several years ago following a drive in his daughter’s Tesla, essentially becoming one of the company’s most outspoken supporters. However, Cramer has moved on from his bullish Tesla outlook.\\n\\nRecently, Cramer’s overwhelming support for Tesla started to crumble after he stated that the Cybertruck would be Musk’s “[first disaster](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-elon-musks-first-disaster-jim-cramer-video/).” Instead, Cramer told car buyers to look at the all-electric F-150 Lightning from Ford, the automaker’s battery-powered version of the United States’ best-selling pickup truck. The F-150 Lightning is set to begin deliveries next Spring.\\n\\nWhile purchasing a vehicle based on aesthetics is purely up to the consumer, there is no evidence to suggest that the Cybertruck will be a disaster at all, especially in terms of interest. In fact, the Cybertruck has already [accumulated over 1.2 million pre-orders](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-cybertruck-pre-orders-reservations-1-2-million-units/). Even if 50% of those orders are unfulfilled based on pure speculation, that would still make the Cybertruck one of the most popular vehicles in the country. The most popular vehicle in the United States is the Ford F-Series, which sold 787,372 units in 2020, according to _[GoodCarBadCar](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/ford-f-series-sales-figures/)._\\n\\nDiscover more\\n\\nSolar-powered gadgets and devices\\n\\nSpace-themed clothing\\n\\nModel X\\n\\nTesla vehicles\\n\\nSolar-powered EV chargers\\n\\nElon Musk merchandise\\n\\nTesla Robotaxi\\n\\nSpaceX facility expansion\\n\\nElectric Vehicle\\n\\nModel S\\n\\nEarlier today, Cramer made another bold statement regarding who he would rather put his trust in between Musk and Ford CEO Jim Farley. His choice would certainly not appease Tesla fans by any measure, as Cramer stated he would much rather have Farley than Musk.\\n\\nJim Farley is undoubtedly a credible CEO, with a proven record of success thus far. He has supported Ford’s transition to electrification, and the company’s stock price has soared since he assumed the role of CEO in October 2020. While Farley has been a supporter and crutch for Ford’s transition away from combustion engines, he is not as innovative or revolutionary as Musk, and there isn’t much of a comparison based on what the two men have done in their careers as CEOs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDiscover more\\n\\nSpaceX rockets\\n\\nElectric vehicle accessories\\n\\nRobotaxi ride experiences\\n\\nTesla-themed art and decor\\n\\nTesla Semis\\n\\nPortable solar panels\\n\\nElon Musk merchandise\\n\\nSolar-powered EV chargers\\n\\nSpace-themed clothing\\n\\nSpaceX Starship\\n\\nIn a matter of months, Cramer has gone from perhaps the biggest Elon fan and supporter to relatively no trust or enthusiasm regarding Tesla or its products. One can only ask: What’s the reason for this?\\n\\nThe flip on Cramer’s view was drastic and uncharacteristic of someone who has supported Tesla and been a very vocal bull for several years. Here are some of the things that Cramer has said about Tesla as recently as May 2021:\\n\\n**May 2021: Elon Musk states Tesla will halt Bitcoin transactions due to environmental concerns**\\n\\n“I don’t know why the hell he said it. I don’t know whether there was another objection besides the environmental, because the environmental [reason] doesn’t hold water. It’s been this way the whole time. But he chose to do this, and I don’t get it. But, he does a lot of things that I can’t fathom that turn out to be brilliant.”\\n\\n> [Tesla’s Bitcoin reversal confuses Jim Cramer, but he’s not giving up on Elon Musk](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-bitcoin-jim-cramer-elon-musk-video/)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDiscover more\\n\\nElon Musk merchandise\\n\\nTesla shop\\n\\nStarship model kits\\n\\nSelf-driving car upgrades\\n\\nSpace-themed educational toys\\n\\nModel S\\n\\nStarship flight simulation experiences\\n\\nSpaceX rockets\\n\\nAI-powered home automation systems\\n\\nTeslarati merchandise\\n\\n**January 2021: Musk’s contribution to Tesla’s valuation**\\n\\n“If you don’t have any, you can still buy some. Don’t buy a lot, but you can certainly still buy some.

Tesla is often compared to companies like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft when these types of discussions come up.\\n\\nFundamentally, yes, Tesla does trade at a P/E level that is significantly above that of any comparable company.\\n\\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that [Tesla is not traded like a typical company, either](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-bear-turns-bullish-two-reasons-stock-continues-boost/).\\n\\nHere’s what Sonnenfeld said regarding Tesla:\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n_“This is the biggest meme stock we’ve ever seen. Even at its peak, Amazon was nowhere near this level. The PE on this, well above 200, is just crazy. When you’ve got stocks like Nvidia, the price-earnings ratio is around 25 or 30, and Apple is maybe 35 or 36, Microsoft around the same. I mean, this is way out of line to be at a 220 PE. It’s crazy, and they’ve, I think, put a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.”_\\n\\nMany analysts have admitted in the past that they believe Tesla is an untraditional stock in the sense that many analysts trade it based on narrative and not fundamentals. Ryan Brinkman of J.P. Morgan once said:\\n\\n_“Tesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals.”_\\n\\nDan Nathan, another notorious skeptic of Tesla shares, [recently turned bullish on the stock because of “technicals and sentiment.”](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-bear-turns-bullish-two-reasons-stock-continues-boost/) He said just last week:\\n\\n_“I think from a trading perspective, it looks very interesting.”_\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nNathan said Tesla shares show signs of strength moving forward, including holding its 200-day moving average and holding against current resistance levels.\\n\\nSonnenfeld’s synopsis of Tesla shares points out that there might be “a little too much emphasis on the magic wand of Musk.”\\n\\n> [Elon Musk just bought $1 billion in Tesla stock, his biggest purchase ever](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-buys-1-billion-tesla-tsla-stock-biggest-purchase-ever/)\\n\\nThis could refer to different things: perhaps his recent [$1 billion stock buy](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-buys-1-billion-tesla-tsla-stock-biggest-purchase-ever/), which sent the stock skyrocketing, or the fact that many Tesla investors are fans and owners who do not buy and sell on numbers, but rather on news that Musk might report himself.\\n\\nTesla is trading around $423.76 at the time of publication, as of 3:25 p.m. on the East Coast.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n[Continue Reading](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-biggest-meme-stock-weve-ever-seen-yale-associate-dean/)\\n\\n### [Elon Musk](https://www.teslarati.com/category/elon-musk/)\\n\\nElon Musk affirms Tesla commitment and grueling work schedule: “Daddy is very much home”\\n========================================================================================\\n\\nThe remarks came as Tesla shares crossed the $400 mark on the stock market.\\n\\n![Image 43](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/simon-alvarez-avatar-46x46.jpg)\\n\\nPublished\\n\\n3 days ago\\non\\n\\nSeptember 16, 2025\\n\\nBy\\n\\n[Simon Alvarez](https://www.teslarati.com/author/simon-alvarez/ \"Posts by Simon Alvarez\")[](https://twitter.com/ResidentSponge)\\n\\n![Image 44](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/elon-musk-wartime-ceo.jpeg)\\n\\nTesla CEO Elon Musk reiterated his commitment to the electric vehicle maker and its future projects this week, responding to speculation following his $1 billion purchase of TSLA stock.\\n\\nThe remarks came as Tesla shares crossed the $400 mark on the stock market, extending a rally fueled in part by Musk’s TSLA purchase.\\n\\n**Elon Musk’s nonstop work schedule**\\n-------------------------------------\\n\\nAmidst the reaction of TSLA stock to Musk’s [$1 billion investment](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-analyst-says-musk-stock-buy-should-send-signal-investors/), Tesla owners such as [@greggertruck](https://x.com/greggertruck/status/1967595205852606837) noted that “Daddy’s home.” Musk replied, stating that “Daddy is very much home.” He then shared details of a packed weekend of work, which was definitely grueling but completely within character for a “wartime CEO.”\\n\\nMusk did note, however, that he had lunch with his kids during the weekend despite his extremely busy schedule.\\n\\n“Daddy is very much home.

Musk reiterated this point late last month as well, when he outlined the [several projects](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-confirms-still-wartime-ceo-mode/) he is juggling among his numerous companies.

This was despite his notable presence on X.\\n\\nWith Tesla Master Plan Part IV being partly released, the company is entering what could very well be its most ambitious stage to date.

This purchase is Musk’s first buy since 2020. To us, this sends a strong signal of confidence in the most important part of Tesla’s future business, robotaxi.”_\\n\\nMusk [putting an additional $1 billion back into the company](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-buys-1-billion-tesla-tsla-stock-biggest-purchase-ever/) in the form of more stock ownership is obviously a huge vote of confidence.\\n\\nHe knows more than anyone about the progress Tesla has made and is making on the Robotaxi platform, as well as the company’s ongoing efforts to solve vehicle autonomy. If he’s buying stock, it is more than likely a good sign.\\n\\nTesla has continued to expand its Robotaxi platform in a number of ways. The project has gotten bigger in terms of service area, vehicle fleet, and testing population. Tesla has also [recently received a permit to test in Nevada](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-lands-regulatory-green-light-robotaxi-testing-new-state-nevada/), unlocking the potential to expand into a brand-new state for the company.\\n\\nIn the note, Dorsheimer also touched on [Musk’s recent pay package](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-engineer-explains-why-elon-musk-deserves-new-pay-package/), revealing that William Blair recently met with Tesla’s Board of Directors, who gave the firm some more color on the situation:\\n\\n_“We recently participated in a meeting with Tesla’s board of directors to discuss the details of Musk’s performance package. The board is confident of its position in the Delaware case and anticipates a verdict by end of year. It does not expect a similar situation to occur under new Texas jurisdiction. Musk has the board’s full support, and we expect he’ll get more than enough shareholder support for this to pass with flying colors.”_\\n\\nTesla stock is up over 6 percent so far today, trading at $421.50 at the time of publication.\\n\\n[Continue Reading](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-analyst-says-musk-stock-buy-should-send-signal-investors/)\\n\\n*   [Latest](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-jim-cramer-love-affair-elon-musk/#mvp-tab-col1)\\n*   [Popular](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-jim-cramer-love-affair-elon-musk/#mvp-tab-col2)\\n*   [Videos](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-jim-cramer-love-affair-elon-musk/#mvp-tab-col3)\\n\\n[![Image 47](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/tesla-model-y-interior-80x80.jpg) News 10 hours ago Tesla Full Self-Driving impressions after three weeks of ownership ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-full-self-driving-impressions-after-three-weeks-of-ownership/)[![Image 48](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/tesla-cybertruck-long-range-rwd-80x80.jpeg) News 13 hours ago Tesla gets price target increase on Wall Street, but it’s a head-scratcher --------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-tsla-price-target-increase-wall-street-head-scratcher/)[![Image 49: Tesla Model S self-presenting door handle](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/tesla-model-s-door-handle-80x80.jpg) Elon Musk 15 hours ago Tesla addresses door handle complaints with simple engineering fix ------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-plans-adjust-heavily-scrutinized-car-part-simple-engineering/)\\n\\n[![Image 50](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/tesla-interior-navigation-fsd-80x80.jpeg) News 3 weeks ago Tesla is overhauling its Full Self-Driving subscription for easier access -------------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-overhauling-full-self-driving-subscription-easier-access/)[![Image 51](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/starship-flight-10-landing-80x80.jpeg) Elon Musk 3 weeks ago Elon Musk shares unbelievable Starship Flight 10 landing feat -------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-shares-unbelievable-starship-flight-10-landing-feat/)[![Image 52](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/starship-flight-10-80x80.jpeg) Elon Musk 3 weeks ago Elon Musk reveals when SpaceX will perform first-ever Starship catch --------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/elon-musk-reveals-when-spacex-will-perform-first-ever-starship-catch/)\\n\\n[![Image 53](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/spacex-starship-flight-7-liftoff-e1737068892658-80x80.jpeg) News 8 months ago SpaceX completes second catch of lower stage, but loses Starship ----------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/spacex-completes-second-catch-lower-stage-loses-starship/)[![Image 54](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/tesla-robotaxi-wireless-charging-80x80.jpg) News 11 months ago Tesla flexes Robotaxi wireless charging — autonomy from top to bottom ---------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-flexes-robotaxi-wireless-charging-autonomy-from-top-to-bottom/)[![Image 55](https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/tesla-semi-iaa-transportation-2024-80x80.jpeg) News 1 year ago Tesla unloads new Semi details: variants, efficiency, fleet data so far -----------------------------------------------------------------------](https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-unloads-new-semi-details-variants-efficiency-fleet-data/)\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDiscover more\\n\\nTeslarati merchandise\\n\\nCybertruck-inspired gadgets\\n\\nTesla Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg\\n\\nTeslarati subscriptions\\n\\nSelf-driving car upgrades\\n\\nSpaceX facility expansion\\n\\nTesla&#8217;s\\n\\nReusable rocket fuel canisters\\n\\nSolar-powered EV chargers\\n\\nElectric Vehicle\\n\\n> 🚨 VERY IMPORTANT: If you are planning to take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit on an EV, you must TAKE DELIVERY by September 30. \\n> \\n> \\n> \\n> If the order is submitted before that date and you do not take delivery, you will not be able to take advantage of the credit.

be downgraded, it\\'s just not worth it, says Jim Cramer\\n\\n[Mad Money with Jim Cramer](https://www.cnbc.com/mad-money/)\\n\\nCNBC\\'s [Jim Cramer](https://www.cnbc.com/jim-cramer-bio/) on Monday pushed backed against recent downgrades of stocks he believes can persevere, including [McDonald\\'s](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/MCD/), [Tesla](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/TSLA/) and [Apple](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL/).\\n\\n\"Some stocks should not be downgraded,\" he said. \"It\\'s just not worth it, because it\\'s only a matter of time before they snap right back.\"\\n\\nSome analysts have been negative on McDonald\\'s, including Morgan Stanley, who worried about [pressure](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/stay-away-from-this-fast-food-giant-as-headwinds-mount-morgan-stanley-says.html) on the fast sector in general. One firm, Loop Capital, fretted over negative feedback for the new chicken strips offering. But Cramer expressed confidence in McDonald\\'s ability to quickly discard unpopular products and adapt to changing conditions. For example, he said, the company rolled out a successful discount meal after customers complained prices had become too high. The strength of McDonalds, Cramer added, is that \"they don\\'t fight battles they can\\'t win — when something doesn\\'t work, they just dump it, and they move on.\"\\n\\nWhile Cramer conceded he\\'s not thrilled about Tesla CEO [Elon Musk](https://www.cnbc.com/elon-musk/)\\'s feud with President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) — or that sales of the company\\'s electric vehicles are [declining](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/22/tesla-tsla-earnings-report-q1-2025.html) — he said he feels there is \"another act coming from Musk.\" He pointed out that Tesla is set to [launch](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/03/tesla-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-has-musk-playing-catch-up-in-hometown.html) robotaxis later this month. Although Tesla was hit with two [downgrades](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/baird-downgrades-tesla-on-trump-musk-fallout-and-high-robotaxi-expectations.html) on Monday, he noted that the stock still managed to close up 4.55%.\\n\\nMuch of Wall Street has soured on Apple, Cramer surmised, noting a dip in enthusiasm at the [Worldwide Developers Conference](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/09/apple-wwdc-2025-live-blog.html). While the iPhone maker is \"in dry spell,\" he claimed it has the capacity to acquire something new, like AI search outfit Perplexity. Apple \"is not a company that stands still,\" Cramer continued.
