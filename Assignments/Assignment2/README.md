### Assignment 2: Personalized Course 


#### Recommendation Engine


**1. Background & Context**


Online learning platforms host thousands of courses across domains—learners often feel 
overwhelmed by choices. A personalized recommender that understands both course 
content and individual learner profiles can boost engagement and completion rates by 
suggesting the most relevant next steps.
**2. Problem Statement**


“Design and implement a Course Recommendation Engine that—given a user query
(completed courses + a short interests blurb)—returns the top-5 most relevant courses 
from a catalog of course offerings, using embedding models and a vector database for 
semantic matching.”

**Embedding Model used**: gemini-embedding-001


**LLM**: gemini-2.0.flash
